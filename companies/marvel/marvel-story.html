    <h2>From Bankruptcy to Box Office Billions: Marvel's Incredible Comeback Story</h2>
    <p><strong>December 27, 1996:</strong> Marvel Entertainment filed for bankruptcy.</p>
    <p>The numbers were brutal:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>$610 million in debt</li>
        <li>Stock price crashed 93% (from $35.75 to $2.38)</li>
        <li>One-third of employees laid off</li>
        <li>Comic book industry in freefall</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most companies would have folded. Marvel chose to fight.</p>
    <h3>The Pivot That Changed Everything</h3>
    <p>Instead of selling assets, Marvel made a counterintuitive move: they doubled down on their intellectual property. While their publishing business was hemorrhaging money, they owned something priceless—decades of beloved superhero characters.</p>
    <h3>The Recovery Blueprint</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Leveraged their IP as collateral</strong> – Put characters like Thor and Captain America on the line for a $525M loan</li>
        <li><strong>Took creative control</strong> – Launched Marvel Studios to maintain quality and vision</li>
        <li><strong>Started with a calculated risk</strong> – Iron Man (2008) with Robert Downey Jr. as their comeback bet</li>
        <li><strong>Built systematically</strong> – Created an interconnected cinematic universe</li>
        <li><strong>Delivered spectacle</strong> – The Avengers (2012) proved the concept with $1.5B+ worldwide</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Transformation</h3>
    <p>Disney acquired Marvel for $4 billion in 2009—just 13 years after bankruptcy. Today, the MCU has generated over $30 billion at the global box office, making it the highest-grossing film franchise in history.</p>
    <h3>The Leadership Lesson</h3>
    <p>This isn't just a superhero story—it's a masterclass in crisis management:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>When your core business model breaks, transform it entirely</li>
        <li>Sometimes your greatest assets are the ones you're not monetizing</li>
        <li>Calculated risks during crisis can yield exponential returns</li>
        <li>Long-term vision beats short-term survival tactics</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Marvel didn't just survive bankruptcy—they used it as a launching pad to create a $30+ billion entertainment empire.<br>
    The most extraordinary comebacks happen when you're completely written off.</p>
